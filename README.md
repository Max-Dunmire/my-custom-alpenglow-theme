# my-custom-alpenglow-theme
The original alpenglow theme had light search bar themes, but if I wanted firefox to be in dark mode it would also switch the background to the dark mode versions
of the svg-s. I wanted to keep the pink light mode svg background, but switch the toolbar to the dark mode. This is different from the already existing Alpenglow Dark
theme extension which uses the darkmode svg-s.
